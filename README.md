# Predicting-Gentrification-in-DC
## Washington was nearly half Black by the mid-20th century, and more than 71 percent by 1970, between the 2000 and 2020, accoring to the U.S. Census, the cityâ€™s Black population dropped from 59 to 41 percent. Today, D.C. has one of the highest rates of displacement in the country.Low-income residents are being pushed out of neighborhoods at some of the highest rates in the country, according to the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity. Most of the people pushed out of these economic hot spots are black and low income, according to the data. In lieu of this explosive issue that faces DC, I sort ought to find whether we can predict which areas in DC are getting gentrified and more importanly "will" be gentrified.
